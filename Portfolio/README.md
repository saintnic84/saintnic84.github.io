<h1>Solar Punk</h1>

<p>I'm a software developer hoping to make a name for myself with a goal of making $100,000 this year</p>

<b>I'm an avid believer in solar punk idealogy. I truly believe that humans can make a utopian future made with technologies not built for profit, but for the preservation of life</b>
